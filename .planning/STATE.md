# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-07)

**Core value:** Every migrated module ships with evidence, from a harness proven to catch planted bugs, that the Rust matches the C on every defined-behavior input; metric is the share of C modules reaching full evidence with zero divergences.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Pinned Toolchain Container

## Current Position

Phase: 1 (Pinned Toolchain Container) — READY TO EXECUTE
Plan: 0 of 0 in current phase (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-07 — Roadmap, requirements and state created from ingested ADR, spec and research docs

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full log in PROJECT.md (`<decisions>` D-01 to D-14, Key Decisions table). Recent:

- [Init]: ADR-0001 LOCKED: Rust Cargo workspace, analysers as pinned subprocesses, Rust agent loop behind a provider trait (D-01 to D-04)
- [Init]: Harness before translator; Phase 7 proves the harness and gates before Phase 8 starts (D-05)
- [Init]: Differential harness runs ILP32 with `-funsigned-char`, separate ASan+UBSan and MSan builds (D-06, D-07)
- [Init]: R1 is a required spike; R2 is time-boxed and may slip to v2.0 (D-10)
- [Init]: MVP "full evidence" excludes Kani proofs (D-14, assumption A-01, awaiting founder confirmation)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Init]: A-01 "full evidence" definition is a roadmapper proposal; confirm before Phase 11 builds the predicate (earlier if Phase 5 or 6 planning needs the fuzz-budget number).
- [Init]: Schedule risk (A-10): 12 phases at 1-2 part-time weeks each is 12-24 weeks against a 13-week Day-90 window. Cut line is in ROADMAP.md Overview (stage 2, R2 spike, scoping report).
- [Init]: Hayroll licence unconfirmed (R3). Send the inquiry to the authors now because replies have lead time; the decision gate is Phase 8.
- [Init]: A-08, MSan is believed to lack 32-bit x86 support (unverified recollection). Verify in Phase 4; affects how R5 and R6 combine.
- [Init]: c2rust fails on 15 of 16 embedded codebases (CCS 2024). Phase 8 must treat its output as a hint, never a dependency.
- [Init]: Open spec questions: first RTOS (Zephyr or FreeRTOS), acceptability of "return error" as UB default, IAR/Keil linking. First one gets recorded in Phase 2.
- [Init]: TRACTOR corpus licence unchecked; use locally only until Phase 12 checks it.
- [Init]: Before starting, check the day-job invention-assignment clause and keep work on own time and hardware.

### Parallel Business Track (not phased)

- Interview about 20 buyers (spec weeks 4-10), land 2-3 design partners, run one paid pilot (weeks 8-13), collect at least 2 pilots or LOIs; enter the count by hand in the Phase 12 gate report. Details in PROJECT.md Context.
